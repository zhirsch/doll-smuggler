You are a drug trafficker. Every day you meet with a different nice older lady (the mule) and find out how much weight she can carry in her handbag. You then meet with your supplier who has packed various drugs into a myriad of collectible porcelain dolls. Once packed with drugs, each of the precious dolls has a unique combination of weight and street value. Sometimes your supplier has more dolls than the nice lady can carry, though space in her handbag is never an issue. Your job is to choose which dolls the kind soul will carry, maximizing street value, while not going over her weight restriction.

**Write a function in the [Clojure](http://clojure.org/) programming language** which given:

* a set of dolls with a name and unique weight and value combination
* an overall weight restriction

Produces the optimal set of drug-packed porcelain dolls which:

* are within the total weight restriction
* maximize the total street value of drugs delivered

Requirements:

* use leiningen - https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen
* include multiple high-level test cases to validate your solution (like the one included below)
* provide instructions in a README for running your test suite from the command line

Input:

    max weight: 400

    available dolls:
